1. পরিচিতি (Overview)

Product name (working): Minimind Outreach Agent
Built by: Minimind Agency
Primary platforms: Facebook (Page & Posts), Email (SMTP/IMAP/Gmail API)
Main goal: automated, personalized, non-spammy cold outreach for design services — human-in-the-loop moderation to avoid policy/brand risk।

2. Minimind Brand / UI Guidelines

Primary colors:

Lime: #c8f031 (Primary accent)

Dark: #212529 (Primary text / nav)

White: #FFFFFF (background / cards)

Typography: Heading — modern sans (e.g., "BS Font Sans Serif"); Body — Arial or system sans.

Tone: Professional, friendly, non-intrusive. Messages should feel like helpful suggestions, not sales spam.

Logo area: top-left — Minimind wordmark (thin pen-stroke feel) with small “Agency” tag.

Spacing & Buttons: rounded corners (8px-12px), soft shadows, padding p-3 / p-4.

3. High-level Feature List (What the agent WILL DO)

Facebook Page Intake

Input: Facebook Page URL (or Page ID) — single or batch CSV upload.

Fetch: Recent posts (images), page metadata (about, contact email, category), page cover/profile images.

Design Quality Analysis (AI Vision + Heuristics)

Visual checks: image resolution, composition, contrast, text readability, logo presence, brand consistency.

Heuristic checks: inconsistent fonts, poor CTA, low image DPI, unbalanced layout, wrong aspect ratio for platform.

Output: scorecard (0–100) + short human-readable diagnosis and suggested improvements.

Need-Decision Module

AI decides if the page likely needs design help (Yes / Maybe / No) with confidence score and short rationale.

Rules: if average score < threshold OR repeated brand inconsistency → Recommend outreach.

Proposal Generator

Personalized proposal draft (short message + customized offering + 1–3 sample suggestions).

Formats: Facebook message version (short), Email version (longer with attachments), and PDF proposal (optional).

Auto-includes examples: 1 quick mockup suggestion (text description), 1 price range, next steps.

Moderator Approval Workflow

Drafts queue for moderator review.

Moderator can: Edit, Approve, Reject, Schedule, or Assign to sales rep.

Approval is required before sending.

Messenger & Email Sender

Sends message via Facebook Page Messaging (or Page Inbox) AND/OR email via SMTP/Gmail API.

Respect rate limits; built-in throttling and send quotas.

Send logs + message preview before final send.

Response Monitoring

Monitors replies (Facebook & email).

Auto-classify replies (positive, neutral, negative, spam).

If no reply within configurable window → auto-generate follow-up draft and submit to moderator or auto-send based on policy.

Follow-up Manager

Multi-step follow-up logic (e.g., 1st follow-up after 5 days, 2nd after 10 days).

Different follow-up tones (gentle reminder, value-add follow-up, last-chance message).

Dashboard & Status Tracking

Overview: campaigns, queued proposals, sent messages, replies, conversions.

Filters: by page, campaign, moderator, status, date.

Export: CSV / XLSX reports.

Audit, Security & Compliance

Logs of messages, approvals, timestamps.

GDPR-friendly opt-out handling.

Rate limiting and policy compliance warnings.

Admin Controls

Team roles (Admin, Moderator, Sales, Analyst).

Per-user quotas and send permissions.

Template management and canned responses.

4. Acceptance Criteria (How we’ll know it’s working)

Functional

Given a Page URL, system fetches posts & images > 95% success (except private pages).

AI produces a design scorecard and a 2–3 sentence rationale for each page.

Proposal generator produces human-grade proposal > 85% of the time (measured by moderator edits).

Moderator approval gate must be mandatory for first 100 sends; configurable later.

Non-Functional

Dashboard loads within 2s for typical queries.

System handles 1,000 pages in a campaign with paging & batching.

Compliance

All outreach respects Facebook/Meta policies and email anti-spam laws (CAN-SPAM/GDPR guidance).

5. Detailed User Flows (Human + AI steps)
Flow A — Single Page Outreach (fast)

User pastes Facebook Page URL → Click Analyze.

System fetches latest 10 image posts.

AI performs Design Quality Analysis → shows Scorecard + Suggested Improvements.

AI decides Need = Yes/Maybe/No (with confidence).

If Yes/Maybe → Agent generates Proposal Draft (FB message + Email body + PDF).

Draft moves to Moderator Queue.

Moderator edits/approves → clicks Send (or schedule).

System sends; begins Response Monitoring.

If no reply after configured days, system creates Follow-up draft (or auto-sends if allowed).

All steps logged; status updated on Dashboard.

Flow B — Bulk Campaign

Upload CSV with Page URLs + optional contact emails.

System queues analyses (throttled).

For each Yes decision → create proposal draft and assign to a moderator batch.

Moderator triages (bulk approve/split/assign).

Campaign sends with rate limit and backoff.

Analytics aggregated per campaign.

6. UI / UX — Screen by Screen (User-friendly)

Goal: clear, minimal steps; show AI explanation; always keep human-in-the-loop.

7. Sample Messages & Proposals (Templates)
Facebook Short Message — Bangla (example)

সাবু, (Facebook Page নাম) —
তুমি যে পেজটা চলে, ওটার গ্রাফিক্স-এ একটু consistency দরকার দেখতেছি। যদি চাও, আমি তোমাদের জন্য ১টা ফ্রি কনসেপ্ট বানিয়ে দেখাতে পারি — তারপর তুমি সিদ্ধান্ত নাও। আগ্রহ থাকলে reply দাও।
— Minimind Agency (Design Team)

Facebook Short Message — English

Hi [Name], I checked your Facebook page and noticed some design inconsistencies that may be affecting engagement. I can share one free concept for you to review — no obligations. Interested? — Minimind Agency (Design Team)

Follow-up 1 (Bangla)

Hi again! গতবার আমি যে প্রস্তাব দিয়েছিলাম সেটা দেখার সুযোগ হলে বলো। ছোট একটা free sample পাঠাতে পারি — দেখে কেমন লাগছে জানিও।

Email Proposal (English — longer)

Subject: Design refresh proposal for [Page Name] — 1 quick concept included

Body:
Hello [Name],
I’m [Your name] from Minimind Agency. We reviewed your Facebook page and see opportunities to improve clarity and engagement through consistent visual branding. Attached is a short proposal including:

1 quick concept (free) you can review

2 pricing options (basic / premium)

Typical timeline: 3–7 business days for a first concept

If you’re open, I’ll send a free concept to start — no obligation. Best, [Name] — Minimind Agency

(Include PDF with visuals & CTA “Reply to this email or click here to schedule a call”)

8. AI Models & Heuristics (What does the AI actually do)

Vision Model: detect text regions, logo presence, image DPI, color palette extraction, aspect ratio, composition heuristics.

NLP Model (Proposal & Messaging): GPT-like model for personalization, template blending, tone control.

Decision Logic: combine heuristics + model output → produce need label with confidence.

Reply Classifier: intent detection (interested / need info / not interested / spam).

9. Data Model / DB Sketch (Simplified)

Pages (id, url, name, category, contact_email, last_analyzed_at)

Analyses (id, page_id, score, issues_json, images_count, analysis_date)

Campaigns (id, name, created_by, status)

Drafts (id, campaign_id, page_id, fb_message, email_body, pdf_path, status)

Messages (id, draft_id, sent_at, platform, message_id, status)

Replies (id, message_id, platform, content, classification, received_at)

Users (id, name, role)

AuditLogs (action, user_id, timestamp, details)

10. Integrations & APIs

Facebook Graph API (pages, posts, messages) — requires Page access + business account.

Gmail API / SMTP / IMAP for email sending/monitoring.

Vision API — OpenAI Vision / Google Vision / custom model (choice depends on privacy & cost).

Storage: S3-compatible (images, pdfs).

Authentication: OAuth for FB/Gmail; JWT for app users.

Optional: Zapier / Make.com connectors for CRM or task systems.

11. Rate-limits, Safety & Policy Considerations

Implement per-page & per-account sending throttle (e.g., max X messages/day).

Respect Facebook messaging policies: only message pages that allow messages; avoid sending to users who opted out.

Provide unsubscribe opt-out mechanism for email and record it.

Keep audit logs for 6–24 months.

GDPR: do not store personal data beyond need; provide data deletion process.

12. Moderator Rules & Workflows (Human-in-loop)

First-run rule: every generated message must be approved by a Moderator (configurable after trust established).

Edit tracking: moderator edits saved as version history.

Auto-suggest: show up to 3 alternative subject lines / opening lines for moderator choice.

Escalation: negative reply classification → escalate to senior sales for human follow-up.

13. KPIs / Success Metrics (for business)

Response rate (replies / messages sent).

Approval-to-send ratio (approved drafts / drafts created).

Conversion rate (signed client leads / replies).

Avg time from analysis → proposal send.

Moderator edit rate (lower is better — indicates AI quality).

14. Phase-wise Roadmap (MVP → v1 → v2)

MVP (6–8 weeks)

Page fetch, image ingestion (manual URL upload)

Vision-based scorecard + need decision

Proposal generator (text only)

Moderator queue + single-send via Email (SMTP)

Basic Dashboard (list + status)

v1 (8–12 weeks)

Facebook Graph send & reply monitoring

PDF proposal export, basic templates

Bulk campaign support and scheduling

Reply classifier & follow-up drafts

v2 (ongoing)

Auto-sending follow-ups with safety heuristics

Integration with CRM (HubSpot)

A/B testing message variants

More advanced vision model and auto-generated mockups (image generation)

15. Example Acceptance Tests (QA)

Given page with low-res post → analysis flags “low resolution” and score < 50.

Generate proposal for page X → moderator opens draft, edits subject, approves → message appears as sent in message center.

No reply for 5 days → follow-up draft is created and visible in queue.

16. Security, Hosting & Cost Considerations

Host backend on AWS / GCP / Azure (Elastic scaling).

Use HTTPS, secure secrets storage (Vault), least-privilege IAM.

Budget items: Vision model costs, Graph API rate limits, email provider costs, storage, dev time.

For enterprise: set up dedicated model instances or allow Minimind-hosted vs on-prem options.

17. Deliverables (What Minimind Agency will hand over)

Full functional web app (Dashboard + Moderator panel).

Source code repo + CI/CD scripts.

Deployment on staging + production (optional).

Admin guide, Moderator guide, API keys setup doc.

3 standard message templates, 5 proposal templates.

30-day support for bug fixes after launch.

18. Risks & Mitigations

Spam & policy risk: Mitigate via moderator gate, rate limits, opt-outs.

FB API restriction: Need Meta Business verification; mitigation — fallback to Email-first outreach.

False-positive/negatives in need assessment: Provide “Maybe” path and human override.

Cost of vision & LLM calls: Optimize by caching analyses and batching.
